			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				I am a student and researcher at <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern
					University</a> as a <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/">QuestBridge</a> Match Scholar.
				Previously, I was a part of the <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/">Array of Things</a> group at
				<a href="https://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a>. My principal investigator was
				<a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~beckman/Home.html">Pete Beckman</a>,
				and I worked on <strong>time-series database solutions</strong> and <strong>machine learning sensor
					calibration for IoT devices</strong>.
				I was recently a Software Engineering intern on the Data Engineering team at <a
					href="https://www.rigup.com">RigUp</a>, where I developed a <strong>data catalog platform</strong>
				for the BI team.
				This coming summer (2021), I will be a Software Engineer intern at <a
					href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau Software</a>.
				<br />
				<br />
				My interests span databases and data science, data security, cloud and ubiquitous computing, and
				user-centered design. I am movitated by <strong>empowering people with data and software</strong>.
				Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Northwestern University,
				exploring NU's research areas of
				<a
					href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/systems-networking.html">systems
					and networking</a>,
				<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/security-privacy.html">security
					and privacy</a>, and
				<a
					href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/human-computer-interaction.html">human-computer
					interaction</a>.
				<br />
				<br />
				I am also currently affiliated with the <a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/">Technological
					Innovations for Inclusive Learning and Teaching</a> lab at NU, where I am developing
				natural multimodal interfaces to allow real-time gaze and voice interaction in Minecraft for the purpose
				of <strong>promoting equitable fun and learning</strong>.
				<br />
				<br />
				I have also been an undergraduate teaching assistant for a couple of courses:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/349.html">COMP_SCI
						349: Machine Learning</a>
					<p>
						<strong>Spring 2020</strong><br />
						Concepts and methods of Machine Learning with Python. Taught by <a
							href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/cossairt-oliver.html">Oliver
							Cossairt</a> and Florian Schiffers.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/111.html">COMP_SCI
						111: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I</a>
					<p>
						<strong>Fall 2019</strong><br />
						Functional Programming with the Racket Student Languages, following <a
							href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs-second-edition">Structure
							and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman.
						Taught by <a href="https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ian/">Ian Horswill</a>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I really like video games, command-line interfaces, trains and subways, Python, Java and C# (working on
				mastering C++), learning, indie music, traveling, cellos, exploring, art and history museums, and
				teaching.
				<br />
				<br />
				Thanks for visiting! Below are a few projects I've worked on. Feel free to check them out.

					<h3>Amundsen</h3>
					<p>
						With the Data Engineering team at <a href="https://www.rigup.com">RigUp</a>, I developed a data
						catalog and its infrastructure to boost productivity and insights for RigUp's analysts.
						This project utilized Lyft's open source <a href="https://www.amundsen.io/">Amundsen</a>
						platform,
						<a href="https://cloud.google.com/">GCP</a>, <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>,
						<a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, <a
							href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>,
						<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, and <a

					<h3>Multicraft</h3>
					<p>
						With <a href="http://www.marceloworsley.com/">Marcelo Worsley</a> at <a
							href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/">TIILT</a>, I developed Gaze and
						Voice interfaces using Java (Minecraft server plugins), Python (natural language
						processing), and C# (eye tracking) to facilitate accessible and equitable gameplay in
						Minecraft. You can view the current repository <a
							href="https://github.com/kevinamendoza/MultiCraft">here.</a>

					<h3>Spotimy</h3>
					<p>
						As an ongoing personal project, I'm developing a web app using <a
							href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to access <a
							href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify's Web API</a>.
						The app is designed to allow the user to explore their library as well as top
						artists and songs to visualize their musical data.
						If you have a Spotify account, you can try it out for yourself <a
							href="https://kevinamendoza.github.io/spotimy/">here</a>.

					<h3>psiAssistiveAgent</h3>
					<p>
						With <a href="http://affectivecognition.com/wp/research/jason-r-wilson/">Jason Wilson</a> in
						NU's <a
							href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/396-496-12.html">
							Affective Computing</a> course, I developed a component of an affective agent to
						train volunteers for emotional support services.
						The component approximates emotions from facial expressions using <a
							href="https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki">OpenFace</a>, and the agent builds
						on Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/psi/wiki">\psi</a> framework.

						class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/timeseries.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<h3>Environmental Data Time Series Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						With <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~beckman/Home.html">Pete Beckman</a> at ANL, I implemented
						a new
						<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database and infrastructure to manage
						time-series environmental data maintained by the AoT research group.
						I then used the data for developing a sensor calibration model combining supervised and
						unsupervised ML models.

					<h3>DuraCot</h3>
					<p>
						As a group in NU's <a
							href="https://design.northwestern.edu/programs/take-design-course/design-thinking-communication/">DTC</a>
						course, we designed a portable changing table to facilitate changing of a 9-year old with
						cerebral palsy. The device allows the caretaker to change the child within the privacy of a
						handicap stall. The design <a
							href="https://design.northwestern.edu/projects/profiles/duracot.html">recieved recognition
							from the Segal Design Institute</a>.
