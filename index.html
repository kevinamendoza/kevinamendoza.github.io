						<h2>About</h2>
						<p> 
							I am a student and researcher at <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> in Evanston, IL as a <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/">QuestBridge</a> National College Match Scholar.
							I currently live in Austin, TX (technically Round Rock, TX) and for the Summer of 2020 I will be working at <a href="https://www.rigup.com">RigUp, Inc.</a>, a company dedicated to improving efficiency of the energy industry through digitizing workforce operations.
							Previously, I was a part of the <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/">Array of Things</a> research group at <a href="https://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a>,
							where my research with time-series database solutions and machine learning sensor calibration allowed for more efficient organization and analysis of environmental sensor data.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							I am interested in data and systems engineeing, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. I also strive to help people (and in previous work, the environment) through systems and data.
							I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Northwestern University with a minor in Psychology, exploring Northwestern's research areas of
							<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/systems-networking.html">systems</a>, 
							<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.html">machine learning</a>, and 
							<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/human-computer-interaction.html">human-computer interaction</a>.
							I have also been affiliated with the following research groups at Northwestern:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/">Technological Innovations for Inclusive Learning and Teaching</a>
								<p>
									<strong>August 2019 - Present</strong><br/>
									Currently, I am developing natural multimodal interfaces to allow real-time gaze and voice interaction in Minecraft.
									Also studying computational thinking and spatial reasoning within the realm of multimodal interfaces and human-computer intaraction.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							I really enjoy video games (like Minecraft), Java, C#, Python, learning, indie music, traveling, cellos, scripting, exploring, art museums, and teaching.
							I have also been an undergraduate teaching assistant for a few courses:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/349.html">COMP_SCI 349: Machine Learning</a>

									<strong>Spring 2020</strong><br/>
									Concepts and methods in Machine Learning with Python. Taught by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/cossairt-oliver.html">Oliver Cossairt</a> and Florian Schiffers.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/111.html">COMP_SCI 111: Fundamentals of Computer Programming I</a>
								<p>
									<strong>Fall 2019</strong><br/>

								<a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/projects/" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/multicraft.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>Multicraft</h3>
								<p>
									With <a href="http://www.marceloworsley.com/">Marcelo Worsley</a> at TIILT, I developed Gaze and Voice interfaces using Java (Minecraft server), Python (Natural Language Understanding Engine), and C# (Eye Tracking) to facilitate accessible and equitable gameplay in Minecraft.
									Both interfaces interact with users' Minecraft Java client through a locally-hosted server.
									You can view the current repository <a href="https://github.com/kevinamendoza/MultiCraft">here.</a>

								<h3>Spotimy</h3>
								<p>
									As a personal learning project, I developed an application using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to access <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify's Web API</a>.
									The app is designed to allow the user to explore their library of songs and albums, their top artists and songs, and their own playlists to visualize their musical data.
									If you have a Spotify account, you can try out the app interface for yourself <a href="https://kevinamendoza.github.io/spotimy/">here</a>.

								<h3>psiAssistiveAgent</h3>
								<p>
									With <a href="http://affectivecognition.com/wp/research/jason-r-wilson/">Jason (Willie) Wilson</a> in Northwestern's <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/396-496-12.html">Affective Computing</a> course,
									I developed a component of an affective agent tasked with training volunteers for emotional support services, such as <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/counseling/outreach-education/wildchat/index.html">Northwestern's Wildchat</a>.
									The component uses <a href="https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki">OpenFace</a> to approximate human facial expressions and emotions, and the system is built on <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/psi/wiki">Mircosoft's Platform for Situated Intelligence</a>.

								<a href="https://design.northwestern.edu/projects/profiles/duracot.html" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/duracot.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>DuraCot</h3>
								<p>
									As a group in Northwestern's <a href="https://design.northwestern.edu/programs/take-design-course/design-thinking-communication/">Design Thinking & Communication</a> course, we designed a portable changing table to facilitate diaper changing of a 9-year old with cerebral palsy.
									The device allows the caretaker to change their child within the privacy of a handicap stall of most public restrooms.
									The design <a href="https://design.northwestern.edu/projects/profiles/duracot.html">recieved recognition by the Segal Design Institute</a>.

								<h3>Time Series Analysis of Environmental Data</h3>
								<p>
									With <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~beckman/Home.html">Pete Beckman</a> at Argonne National Laboratory, I designed a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database to manage time-series environmental data maintained by the AoT research group.
									I then used the data for developing a sensor calibration model combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.
									The new model lowered reported temperature error for nodes by about 60%.

								<h3>SmartCloset</h3>
								<p>
									As a group in Northwestern's <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/330.html">Human Computer Interaction</a> course,
									I developed a simple prototype of a web application designed to assist the user in searching through their wardobe, creating outfits, exploring new styles, and finding new pieces to add to their wardrobe.
									You can try out the app interface for yourself <a href="https://smartcloset330.github.io/smartcloset/home.html?">here</a> and view the repository <a href="https://github.com/smartcloset330/smartcloset">here</a>.
