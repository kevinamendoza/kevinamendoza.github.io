							<h2>About</h2>
						</header>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am a computer scientist, researcher, and student at <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> in Evanston, IL.
							I live in Austin, TX and will be working on full stack and end-to-end platform features at <a href="https://www.rigup.com/">RigUp Inc.</a>, a company dedicated to improving efficiency of the energy industry through digitizing operations.
							Previously, I was a part of the <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/">Array of Things</a> research project group at <a href="https://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a>,
							where my research on time-sensitive database solutions and machine learning sensor calibration allowed for more efficient organization and accurate analysis of environmental sensor data.
						<br/>
							My interests lie in helping people (and in previous work, helping the environment) through machine learning and data.
							More specifically, I am interested in machine learning, algorithms, cognition, and human-computer or human-AI interaction.
							I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science from Northwestern University with a Psychology Minor, exploring the areas of 
							<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.html">artificial intelligence and machine learning</a> 
							as well as <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/human-computer-interaction.html">human-computer interaction</a>.
							I have also been affiliated with the following research groups at Northwestern:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/">tiilt</a>, where I am currently developing multimodal interfaces and researching computational thinking and spatial reasoning within the realm of human computer interaction using Minecraft.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							You can see more about me and the work I've done using the links below. My favorite languages are Java, C#, Python, and Javascript
							Apart from computer science, I'm a fan of learning, teaching, listening to and exploring new music, playing the cello, and drawing.

								<h3>Multicraft</h3>
								<p>
									I have been working on this project with guidance from <a href="http://www.marceloworsley.com/">Professor Marcelo Worsley</a> at tiilt.
									In this project, I am designing and actively developing multimodal interfaces such as Gaze (Tobii Eyetracking with C#) and Speech (currently IBM Watson AI Speech to Text with Python) to empower individuals with physical impairments to play and create in Minecraft.
									Both interfaces interact with Minecraft through a locally-hosted server (Spigot server using Bukkit server plugins with Java).
									You can see the current repository <a href="https://github.com/kevinamendoza/MultiCraft">here.</a>

								<h3>Time Series Analysis of Environmental Data</h3>
								<p>
									I worked on this project throughout my internship at Argonne National Laboratory as part of a research initiative led by <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~beckman/Home.html">Pete Beckman</a>.
									The project involved designing a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database extended with <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb">TimescaleDB</a> to manage the time-series environmental data and metadata gathered by nodes maintained and used by the Array of Things research group.
									Once in use, the time-series data from the database was then used for developing a temperature sensor calibration model utilizing a combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning models using Python and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>. The new model lowered reported temperature error for nodes in the Chicago area during the summer by about 60%.

								<a href="https://design.northwestern.edu/projects/profiles/duracot.html" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/duracot.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h3>DuraCot</h3>
								<p>
									This project was a part of Design Thinking and Communication (DTC), a course in Northwestern's 
									<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/engineering-first.html"></a>Engineering First Program</a>
									in the McCormick School of Engineering.
									Working in a small team of students, we designed and developed a collapsible changing table to facilitate diaper changing of a 9-year old with cerebral palsy.
									The portable changing table allows the caretaker to change the diaper within the privacy of a handicap stall of most public restrooms.
									This project involved solving real-world problems and the concept of human-centered design.
