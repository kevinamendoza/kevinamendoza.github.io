            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
            I am a Software Engineer on <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau Software's</a> Platforms team
            and recent graduate from <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>
            as a <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/">QuestBridge</a> Match Scholar.

            In Summer 2021, I was a Software Engineering intern at Tableau, where I
            spearheaded an alternative continuous delivery solution to automate
            versioning, releasing, and publishing of JVM binaries and artifacts
            from Gradle projects in Tableau's modular monolith codebase.

            I was also a Software Engineering intern on the Data Engineering team
            at RigUp (now <a href="https://www.workrise.com">Workrise</a>), where
            I constructed a data catalog platform for their Business Intelligence team.

            Finally, I was also a member of the <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/">Array of Things</a>
            research group at <a href="https://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a> (ANL),
            working with <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~beckman/Home.html">Pete Beckman</a>
            on time-series database solutions and machine learning-based sensor calibration for IoT devices.

            <br />
            <br />
            My interests span information systems and data engineering, scalable
            cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and user-centered design. Minus the jargon, I am motivated
            by the idea of <strong>empowering people with high-quality data and software</strong>.
            I graduated Summa Cum Laude with Bachelor and Master of Science degrees
            in Computer Science, emphasizing on NU's research areas of
            <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/systems-networking.html">systems and networking</a> and
            <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/research/areas/human-computer-interaction.html">human-computer interaction</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            While studying at Northwesern, I was also affiliated with the following research groups:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://presciencelab.org">Prescience Lab</a>, part
                    of the Northwestern University Parallelism Group, where I
                    directed development of a port of the <a href="https://github.com/HExSA-Lab/nautilus">Nautilus Aerokernel</a>
                    for <a href="https://riscv.org">RISC-V</a> platforms and hardware.</li>
                <li><a href="https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/">Technological Innovations for Inclusive Learning and Teaching</a>,
                    where I led a team of developers in creating a multimodal interface platform for real-time gaze, voice, and gesture interaction in Minecraft.
            </ul>
            I have also been an undergraduate teaching assistant for a couple of courses:

            <br />
            <br />
            My favorite languages right now are Java, C/C++, Rust, Go, and Racket. 
            When I'm not coding, I spend the rest of my time enjoying video games,
            playing with terminals and text editors, riding trains and subways, 
            listening to indie music, traveling, playing my cello, touring art 
            and history museums, learning, and teaching.
